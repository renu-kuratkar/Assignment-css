            <p>The Savitribai Phule Pune University (formerly known as University of Poona) was established on 10th February
                1949 under the Poona University Act, passed by the Bombay Legislature in 1948. In the same year, Dr. M. R.
                Jayakar assumed office as the first vice chancellor of the University.

            <p>Shri B.G.Kher, Chief Minister and Education Minister, Govt. of Bombay, took a keen interest in setting apart
                a beautiful campus for the University. As a result of his efforts, a campus extending over 411 acres was
                allocated to the University in early 1949, on lease of 999 years without any premium and payment of nominal
                lease rent of a One per annum. Payment of certain taxes such as N.A. Tax etc have also been waived.</p>

                the establishment of the Shivaji University, Kolhapur, in 1964, the jurisdiction of the University was
                restricted to 5 districts, namely Pune, Ahmednagar, Nasik, Dhule and Jalgaon. Out of these, two districts -
                Dhule and Jalgaon are attached to the North Maharashtra University established in August 1990.</p>
