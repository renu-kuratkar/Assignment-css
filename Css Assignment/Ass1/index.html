    <h1> Introduction of Maharana Pratap</h1>
    <h4>
        <p>
                Maharana Pratap, is a name worth remembering to begin one's day with. His name is engraved with gold among the
                    list of valiant kings who protected the Nation, Dharma, Culture and Freedom of this country by sacrificing his
                    life ! This is a holy remembrance of his valour !
                    Who does not know the name of the great king of Mewar, Maharana Pratap Singh? In the history of India, this name
                    has always proved to be motivating for qualities like valour, bravery, sacrifice and martyrdom. Many brave
                    warriors like Bappa Rawal, Rana Hamir, Rana Sang were born unto the Sisodiya family of Mewar and were given the
                    title of Rana's but the title of Maharana was only bestowed on Pratap Singh.

        <h1>Childhood of Maharana Pratap</h1>
      
        <h4>
            <p>Maharana Pratap was born in 1540. Rana Uday Singh, the Second, of Mewar had 33 children. Among them, the eldest
                was Pratap Singh. Self-respect and virtuous behaviour were the main qualities of Pratap Singh. Maharana Pratap
                was bold and brave right from his childhood and everyone was sure that he was going to be a very valiant person
                as he grew up. He was more interested in sports and learning to wield weapons rather than general education.</p>
        </h4>

    <h1>Maharana Pratap's Coronation</h1>
    <h4>
        <p> During Maharana Pratap Singh's time, Akbar was the Mughal Ruler in Delhi. His policy was to make use of the
            strength of Hindu kings to bring other Hindu Kings under his control. Many Rajput kings, abandoning their
            glorious traditions and fighting spirit, sent their daughters and daughters-in-law to the harem of Akbar with
            the purpose of gaining rewards and honour from Akbar. Uday Singh appointed before his death, Jagammal, the son
            of his youngest wife as his heir although Pratap Singh was elder to Jagammal but he was ready to give up his
            rights like Prabhu Ramchandra and go away from Mewar but the chieftains did not at all agree with their kingâ€™s
            decision. Besides they were of the opinion that Jagammal did not possess qualities like courage and self-respect
            which were essential in a leader and king. Hence it was collectively decided that Jagammal would have to
            sacrifice the throne. Maharana Pratap Singh too gave due respect to the wish of the chieftains and the people
            and accepted the responsibility of leading the people of Mewar.</p>
